# 💰 Insurance Amount Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **medical insurance charges** based on customer details using **Machine Learning**.
It includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building** to create an accurate prediction system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The notebook goes through the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries** – Required packages such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding the dataset by analyzing distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting and transforming useful information from the dataset.
4. **Encoding** – Applying Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding on categorical variables.
5. **Model Building** – Training regression models to predict insurance charges.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluating model performance using metrics such as R² Score and RMSE.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset `insurance.csv` contains the following features:

* **age** – Age of the insured individual
* **sex** – Gender of the insured
* **bmi** – Body Mass Index (BMI)
* **children** – Number of children/dependents
* **smoker** – Whether the person is a smoker (yes/no)
* **region** – Residential region of the insured
* **charges** – Medical insurance charges (Target variable)

## 📈 Expected Insights

* Smokers tend to have **significantly higher insurance charges**.
* BMI and age play a crucial role in determining insurance costs.
* Families with more children may have slightly higher charges.
